# Stable-Matching-Oracle
A testing framework for verifying stable matching algorithms. It generates random preference lists for companies and candidates, runs multiple test cases, and validates the algorithm's correctness by ensuring all entities are matched exactly once, preferences are valid, and no unstable pairs exist. Ideal for debugging and research.
